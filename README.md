# odin-event-manager

This is my implementation of the Event Manager project from the Ruby course on The Odin Project.

It's a program which can extract names, phone numbers and peak registration times from a given set of event attendee data, generating personalized thank you letters reminding each attendee of which legislators they can turn to for political action.
